        <h2>JayPlus</h2>
        <p>
          JayPlus is a specialized business management software designed for car
          detailing businesses. Through this web application, businesses can let
          their customers book service appointments via their unique subdomains
          and seamlessly manage operations from the admin dashboard. Its current
          capabilities prominently feature robust booking and management tools.

            <h3>Inspiration</h3>
            <span>(February 2022)</span>
            <p>
              During my part-time job at a car detailing shop, I learned a ton
              about the business, especially since the owner, Moe, was a friend
              of mine. I quickly spotted several inefficiencies. Sometimes we
              had customers waiting, but no detailers available; other times, it
              was the opposite. Moe struggled with four different apps to run
              the business and two more just for bookings. Unfortunately, none
              of them really fit the scheduling needs of a detailing business.
              Around this time, Damon, my cousin and teammate on the project,
              asked about diving into UX Design. I had already given him some
              pointers on where to start. Seeing an opportunity, I brought him
              into the fold, sharing the issues I'd noticed at the shop, and
              together, we brainstormed solutions.

            <span>(April 2022)</span>
            <p>
              After Damon completed the initial prototype, I was genuinely
              impressed, prompting me to commit to the project wholeheartedly.
              We presented the prototype to Moe, whose positive feedback
              confirmed our belief in its potential. To make it even better, we
              refined it based on additional feedback gathered from interviews
              with Moe and his customers.

            <h3>MVP Challenges</h3>
            <span>(September 2022)</span>
            <p>
              After finalizing the prototype, we began developing the MVP. At
              that time, I was juggling additional courses at school, so I
              enlisted my brother—who's skilled with PHP—to help build the app.
              Keen to get a functioning MVP quickly, we chose Laravel and
              LiveWire. I mapped out a detailed work breakdown structure to kick
              off the building process. While we successfully integrated the
              booking system, we faced hurdles with payment, SMS, and several
              other features due to LiveWire's limited documentation and my
              unfamiliarity with the platform. This led us to consider a
              complete rewrite.

            <h3>Tech Pivot & Learning</h3>
            <span>(November 2022)</span>
            <p>
              My brother and I were keen to learn Golang, and since I was
              already familiar with React, I took on the frontend while he
              handled the backend in Golang. We rebooted the project, laying out
              detailed tasks. He quickly developed the backend, outpacing my
              frontend work. This meant we had a backend ready but no frontend
              to test it against. When I did finish the frontend, we encountered
              several glitches. By then, my brother had joined a startup and had
              little time for our project. That pushed me to dive into Golang
              myself, and I spent several months on various projects before
              revisiting JayPlus.

            <h3>Restructuring & Focus</h3>
            <span>(May 2023)</span>
            <p>
              I was frustrated with the prolonged development of the project, so
              I dedicated myself until May to learn about project and product
              management. Additionally, starting my role as a test automation
              engineer in March, I gained significant insights into integration
              and testing.
              <br /><br />
              Wanting clarity on the end-goal, I drafted a detailed
              specification document. Influenced by the works of Robert C.
              Martin and Martin Fowler, I had a keen interest in clean code and
              architecture. While I contemplated between microservices and a
              monolithic setup, I wasn't swayed by the current trends. What
              appealed to me about microservices was the distinct separation of
              responsibilities and the capacity for independent teams to manage
              separate services. However, I recognized that my application's
              functions needed cohesion and that scaling wouldn't necessitate
              isolated service deployments based on potential traffic. This
              realization led me to merge the Domain Driven Design approach of
              microservices into a modular monolithic structure. My
              specification document, hence, began with a tech overview and
              delved deep into each module, backend routes, and frontend
              components. I crafted it meticulously, driven by my determination
              to ensure the project's success this time around.

            <h3>Infrastructure and Basics</h3>
            <span>(June 2023)</span>
            <p>
              I realized that if I wanted anyone to easily contribute to the
              app, setting up CICD was essential. Even though I'd sidestepped
              this for four years, the time had come. After diving into Docker
              and exploring various deployment methods, I chose to purchase a VM
              from DigitalOcean and integrate CI via GitHub Actions. It was a
              milestone moment for me; I'd completed numerous projects in the
              past, but this was the first where I could simply share my domain
              and grant someone instant access to the app – it felt distinct
              from just sharing static websites.
              <br /><br />
              For this phase, I started with the backend basics. I established
              the architecture, devised the modules, and initialized routes and
              handlers, mainly using GET requests to relay placeholder data that
              would later be replaced. When it came to the frontend, I took my
              foundational knowledge and, having gained deeper insights into
              React, I revamped the entire interface. This involved leveraging
              custom hooks, crafting efficient utility functions, and rectifying
              my initial over-reliance on useEffects.

            <h3>Backend Deep Dive</h3>
            <span>(August 2023)</span>
            <p>
              Once the frontend was nearly complete, I dove into backend
              development. I invested in a managed Postgres database and began
              shaping my models, crafting an ERD, and setting up handlers and
              queries. I encountered a significant challenge with the
              architecture I had chosen: Go's prohibition of cyclical
              dependencies. This was a curveball for me, leading to the
              integration of interfaces and passing the database as a dependency
              to the application. Initially, the backend took just a few days,
              but the nuances soon surfaced. To handle subdomains and SSL, I
              honed my skills with NginX. While integrating Stripe for payments
              and Twilio for SMS presented their own challenges, the most
              time-consuming aspect was perfecting the booking algorithm. In the
              end, I introduced overflow to timeslots and incorporated specific
              calculations to ensure the booking system was both flexible and
              tailored to the needs of car detailing businesses.
