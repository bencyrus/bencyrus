        <h2>JayPlus</h2>
        <p>
          JayPlus is a business management software for car detailing
          businesses. The web application allows each business to have their
          customers book service appointments through their subdomain and manage
          their business through the admin dashboard. The current version
          includes booking and booking management functionality.

            <h3>February 2022</h3>
            <p>
              I was working part time at a car detailing shop while studying.
              The owner was a friend of mine and I learned a lot about the
              business. I noticed a large number of inefficiencies. We had
              customers and we didn't have detailers or we had detailers and no
              customers. Moe (the owner) was using 4 different apps to manage
              the business and 2 to manage bookings and none of them worked for
              the scheduling requirements of a detailing business.<br />At the
              time Damon (My cousin and teammate on proejct) asked me how to
              learn UX Design and I had given him a roadmap. As his portfolio
              project, I shared the problem with him and we discussed solutions.

            <p>
              Damon finished the initial prototype and I was so impressed that I
              decided to take the project seriously and build it out.<br />We
              started by showing Moe the prototype and he really liked it. We
              knew we had something so we refined the prototype based on further
              user interviews with Moe and his cutomers.

            <h3>September 2022</h3>
            <p>
              The prototype was finalized and we started building the MVP. I was
              taking extra courses at school at the time so I hired my brother
              to build the app. He is great with PHP and I wanted a functioning
              MVP asap so we used Laravel and LiveWire. I wrote a work breakdown
              structure and we started building the MVP.<br />
              We built the booking but got stuck on payment, sms and many small
              features we had problem doing in LiveWire. Lack of documentation
              and my unfamilarity with the tools. So we decided to go through a
              rewrite.

            <p>
              My brother and I both wanted to learn Golang and I knew React so I
              decided to build the frontend in React and my brother would do the
              backend in Golang. We started the project again with detailed jobs
              to be done. He was much faster at building the backend than I
              could build the frontend so he made something but we couldn't test
              because there wasn't a frontend. I finally built a frontend but a
              lot of small things didn't work and by this time, my brother was
              working for a startup and did not have any time to work on the
              app. So I started learning Golang. Spent a few months building
              proejcts before starting JayPlus.

            <h3>May 2023</h3>
            <p>
              I was pissed off about this project taking so long so until May, I
              learned as much as I could about project and product management. I
              also started working as a test automation engineer in March and
              learned a lot aout integration and testing in general.<br /><br />Starting
              wiht exactly what I need to be done in the end, I wrote a
              specificaiton document. At the time I read too much Robert C.
              Martin and Martin Fowler so I was obsessed with clean code and
              architecure. I was debating whether to go the microservices route
              or a simple monolithic application. I am not one to follow the
              hype so I realized what I like about microservices is clear
              separation of concerns and the fact that different teams or
              individuals can work on completely serparate services. But for my
              app to work, all the services would need to work at the same time,
              and even at scale I wouldn't relly need to independently deploy
              services based on projected eventual traffic. So I decided to take
              Domain Driven Design from microservices and apply it to my
              monolithic application and the result was a service ortiented
              (modular) monolithic application. So with that decision finalized,
              I started the specification document.<br /><br />
              The document started with an overview of the application and
              technology in use and further down outlined every module and even
              route the backend would need and the frontend pages and
              components. I think I did it like that because I really wanted it
              to work this time.

            <p>
              Noticing if I really want anyone to be able to jump in and work on
              the app, I need CICD set up. I had avoided that for 4 years but it
              was the time. I learned Docker and Different ways of deployment
              but eentually, decided to just buy a VM from DigitalOcean and set
              up CI in GitHub Actions. I couldn't believe it. I had made many
              projects but it was the first time I could just send my domain to
              someone and they could access my app (I had done that with static
              websites before but this was something else).
              <br /><br />
              This time, I started with the basics of backend. I created my
              architecture, created my modules and set up routes and handler
              that were just GET requests to send back dummy data in the format
              that I would eventually send. Then, it was time for frontedn. I
              had a base but I had learned more about React so I reimplemented
              the fronend. Using custom hooks, clean utility functions and
              initially too many useEffects which I fixed later.

            <h3>August 2023</h3>
            <p>
              With frontend almost finished, I started working on the backend.
              Bought a managed Postgres database and started implementing my
              models. Created an ERD, models, handlers and queries. The biggest
              challenge at this point for me was the architecture I was using.
              Go does not allowl cyclical dependencies which was new to me so I
              added interfaces and passed database as dependency to my app.
              <br />
              The initial backend to me a few days but then the little things
              came up. Since I needed to implement subdomains and SSL, I learned
              to wrok with NginX better. Used Stripe for payment and twilio for
              SMS. They weren't the most straightforward to implement but it was
              the booking algorithm which took the most time. I eventually
              implemented overflow to timeslots and a few specific calculations
              to make the booking flexible and work with detailing business
              requirements.
