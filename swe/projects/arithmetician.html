        <h2>Arithmetician</h2>
        <p>
          Arithmetician is an enhanced arithmetic training platform, tailored
          for those aiming to sharpen their mental math abilities, from finance
          professionals preparing for interviews to students gearing up for
          exams. Built on a Ruby on Rails backend and a React frontend, the
          platform not only challenges users with rapid arithmetic problems but
          also stores their scores in a PostgreSQL database. Users can review
          their progress by accessing their historical scores, selectively
          remove results if they believe an attempt was non-representative, and
          even revisit the exact question prompts they tackled.

            <h3>Origin of Idea</h3>
            <p>
              During my tenure as a portfolio manager, I delved into derivatives
              in the stock market. Recognizing the potential in Iran's stock
              options market, I developed a webscraper to spot arbitrage
              opportunities. With limited algorithmic trades and companies
              occasionally issuing attractively priced options, I leveraged the
              tool to quadruple my portfolio in a single year. Encouraged by a
              mentor, I set my sights on becoming a quantitative financial
              analyst (which I obviously didn't become because building software
              is more rewarding). A crucial requirement? Lightning-fast mental
              math. Despite a thorough search, platforms that catered to
              tracking progress were absent, leading me to rely on
              <a href="https://www.arithmetic.zetamac.com">Zetamac</a> and
              manual spreadsheet entries.

            <h3>Building the App</h3>
            <p>
              Fast forward to my life as a software engineer, my interview with
              HomeStars, a company whose engineering team I admired, presented
              the perfect opportunity. Eager to impress and align with their
              tech stack, I dived into building the app using Ruby on Rails and
              React. Over an intense 35 hours, the first version took shape.
              Although the interview went well, HomeStars opted for a candidate
              with slightly more experienceâ€”a decision I respected. Their
              positive feedback from my interviewers, coupled with the sheer joy
              of developing the platform, made the entire experience worthwhile.

            <h3>Thoughts on Ruby on Rails</h3>
            <p>
              Having previously spent six months with Ruby on Rails at Yuhu, I
              was familiar with the framework but building an entire project
              from the ground up using the framework was a fresh challenge.
              Honestly, it felt like magic at times! For my personal projects, I
              gravitate towards frameworks where I have more control over the
              code. That said, seeing how powerful and efficient Rails can be, I
              totally get why top-notch companies opt for it. If a future
              project called for Ruby on Rails, I'd definitely jump back in.

            <h3></h3>
            <p>
              While I embarked on this project to showcase my skills, the
              journey turned out to be immensely educational, and I ended up
              with a project I really like on my portfolio. Along the way, I
              significantly sped up my proficiency in setting up CICD with
              Docker, a VM, and GitHub Actions. Moreover, I honed my ability to
              quickly ship a product and draft specification documents.
