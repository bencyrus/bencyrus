              Understand Your Student Archetype and Course Load Flexibility
            </h3>
            There are generally three types of students in the Computer
            Programming Program (CPP):
            <ul>
              <li style="margin-bottom: 10px">
                <strong>The Fast Trackers:</strong>
                <br />
                These students aim to complete the program quickly by taking a
                heavy course load. Good news - there's no cap on the number of
                courses you can enroll in, provided you meet the prerequisites!
              </li>
              <li style="margin-bottom: 10px">
                <strong>The Steady Goers:</strong>
                <br />
                These students prefer a balanced approach, not too fast yet not
                too drawn out. They follow a more traditional path through the
                semesters.
              </li>
              <li style="margin-bottom: 10px">
                <strong>The Slow and Steadies:</strong>
                <br />
                These students prefer a lighter course load. They may have other
                commitments, such as work or family, that prevent them from
                taking more than 3 or 4 courses per semester.

          <div>
            <h3>Start Strong: Divide and Conquer</h3>
            Before you start your first semester, you should have a good idea of
            what courses you'll be taking and when based on your student
            archetype. Check the Scheduling tool to find the real pre-requisites
            for all of your courses. Will tell you more about each course later.
            <br />
            You should also understand the weight of each task in your courses
            so you can plan strategically.

            <div>
              <h3>Course Maps and Prerequisites Are NOT Accurate</h3>
              Contrary to what you may think, the official course map provided
              but the school is not accurate. It identifies some pre-requisites
              that are wrong, and does not tell you how else you can arrange
              your courses.
              <br />
              <strong>First Semester Insight:</strong>
              <br />
              The suggested courses are IPC144, APS145, CPR101, ULI101, and
              COM111. However, what's not explicitly stated is your freedom to
              choose any electives (ELS) without prerequisites. Feeling
              ambitious? You can opt for more than the recommended five courses,
              but caution is advised during the initial semester.
              <br />
              <strong>The Truth About Prerequisites:</strong>
              <br />
              Not all solid lines (indicating prerequisites in the course map)
              are accurate. For instance, though PMC is listed for the 4th
              semester, it doesn't actually require prior courses! Strategic
              course selection can potentially enable you to complete the CPP
              program in just three semesters or have a very light last semester
              to focus on your job hunt.
              <br />

              <br />
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Q:</strong> Is it ok if I don't have a full-time
                  course load in my last semester?
                  <br />
                  <strong>A:</strong> Yes, you can take any number of courses
                  you like in your last semester. Even one course is fine. It
                  won't impact your graduation or immigration status.

              <h3>You May Encounter Hurdles</h3>
              Failing a course isn't the end of the world, but it requires smart
              recalibration of your plan. I recommend taking IPC144 and OOP244
              in your first two semesters and not failing them since they are
              pre-requisites. However, if you do, that doesn't mean you have to
              take an extra semester. You will just have to move a few courses
              around to make up for it.
              <br />
              <h4 style="margin: 10px 0">Scenarios to Consider:</h4>
              <ul>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 10px">
                  <strong>Failing IPC144:</strong>
                  <br />
                  If you stumble with IPC144, retaking it becomes your priority.
                  Since this setback restricts you from advancing to OOP244,
                  Web211, or SFT221, you can still maintain the course of your
                  program and graduate within the 4 semesters by taking IPC144,
                  DBS211, EAC594, and PMC115 as well as your electives. Since
                  EAC594 and PMC115 are much less time-consuming than OOP244,
                  WEB211, and SFT221, taking all of your electives to balance
                  the load over your semesters is advisable.
                  <br />
                  Although a 7-course semester looks scary, I would argue this
                  combination is actually easier than your regular second or
                  third semester. If you still are not comfortable with 7, take
                  6 and one elective in your third semester.
                </li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 10px">
                  <strong>Failing OOP244:</strong>
                  <br />
                  Failing OOP244 can complicate your journey, but it's not a
                  roadblock to your four-semester plan. This misstep means
                  OOP345, DSA456, and almost all professional options are off
                  the table for now. However, you can keep pace by opting for
                  DBS311, WEB322, SYD366, and any remaining electives or courses
                  like PMC115 or EAC594 if you haven't taken them yet. Brace
                  yourself, though; a hiccup with 244 can make your final
                  semester a bit harder, but nothing too crazy.
                  <br />
                  Your fourth semester would typically feature heavy hitters
                  like OOP345, DSA456, and a Professional Option, along with any
                  electives or leftover courses. Playing it smart means you've
                  already tackled some, leaving just these critical few. It's
                  about strategic course management — taking the right subjects
                  at the right time keeps you on track, even when there are
                  bumps along the way.
                  <br />
                  <strong>Note:</strong> Course map and your advisors say that
                  OOP345 is a pre-requisite to DSA456. That is incorrect. OOP244
                  is and even my professor was surprised to learn that.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Failing OOP345:</strong>
                  <br />
                  A hiccup with OOP345 isn't a showstopper — seriously, no need
                  for panic! Unexpectedly, OOP345 isn't the gatekeeper it's
                  often made out to be. Sure, it's a bummer, but it doesn't
                  spell doom for your four-semester timeline. You still have a
                  buffet of professional options to explore that don't list
                  OOP345 as a prerequisite. So, your last semester might look
                  like this: retake OOP345, add on DSA456, and throw in
                  whatever's left on your plate. Quick fact: OOP345 isn't
                  actually a pre-req for DSA456, so that's a bonus! Keep your
                  chin up and your strategy flexible.

              <strong>Critical Early Assignments:</strong>
              <br />
              Prioritizing initial assignments, labs, quizzes, and workshops is
              crucial for two key reasons. Firstly, these early tasks often
              carry simpler objectives, providing a more accessible opportunity
              to secure high grades. These act as a buffer, potentially
              offsetting any future shortcomings or difficulties with more
              complex tasks. Secondly, the foundational knowledge laid out in
              the first half of the semester is indispensable for understanding
              more advanced concepts introduced later on. Thus, a solid grasp of
              these basics paves the way for a smoother, more successful
              learning trajectory.

              <strong>Real Pre-requisites for Courses:</strong>
              <br />
              Contrary to popular belief, not all courses have strict
              prerequisites. Here's a quick rundown to help you navigate:
              <ul>
                <li>Most electives: No prerequisites — take them anytime!</li>
                <li>
                  PMC115: No prerequisites, but be persistent in enrolling as it
                  often prioritizes last-semester and CPA students. You might
                  snag a spot eventually.
                </li>
                <li>
                  IPC144, APS145, CPR101, ULI101, COM111 or 101: No specific
                  pre-requisites.

              <strong>The Udemy Advantage:</strong>
              <br />
              Don't dismiss Udemy! It's a perfect supplement to your learning.
              Think of it as a time-saver, not extra work. Courses often drop to
              $15-20 when you create a new account. I personally have many. Or
              you can just have 1 account and contact support. They will give
              you 90% discount. Code along with the tutorials; don't just assume
              you know the content.

              <strong>Experience Doesn't Equal Ease:</strong>
              <br />
              Just because you've programmed before doesn't mean CPP will be a
              cakewalk. Even if you have years of experience in languages like
              Python, IPC144, OOP244, OOP345 might offer a unique challenge. And
              that is not just because they are in C and C++; Seneca has make
              them very demanding. I personally found it tougher despite having
              3 years of programming experience in other languages.

            <h4 style="margin: 10px 0">Study Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Don't solely rely on your course professor. Even forget you have
                one and supplement your learning with the Udemy course and aim
                to study ahead of the class schedule. Really learning this
                course can save your time massively in the future.
              </li>
              <li>
                Each week, cross-reference the upcoming course topics with the
                Udemy course and study in advance.
              </li>
              <li>
                Try to complete the Udemy course based on the order of your
                college curriculum for the most aligned experience.
              </li>
              <li>
                Don't worry if you feel dumbfounded or feel like you don't
                understand anything! That's normal.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <strong>Note: </strong>When you learn it from Udemy first (which
            goes into more depth than your prof) then when the prof explains,
            you totally get it! This way you spend 2-4 extra hours a week but I
            promise you, it saves you more than 10 hours a week when doing the
            workshops and final project!
            <h4 style="margin: 10px 0">Extra Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Prioritize the first few workshops, as you may find the latter
                ones more challenging.
              </li>
              <li>
                Don't let pointers and file reading intimidate you. Seek out
                additional resources, hire a tutor, or join study groups to
                grasp these concepts better. If you learn them, you will find
                OOP244 much easier than I found it!
              </li>
              <li>
                Unless you have enough time and really want to practice IPC144,
                do not enroll in a class with Prof. Cameron Gray due to
                potential workload disparities. He doesn't hesistate to fail
                half of the class if needed.

                Approach this course similarly to IPC144: supplement your class
                lectures with the Udemy course. I personally would watch the
                Udemy course before the semester starts, or at least be ahead of
                the class schedule in watching the course. You may not have time
                to watch it in the second half of the semester.

                There are a few concepts that can confuse you. Constructors and
                destructors, pointers, file reading, operator overloading are
                some of them. My advice: Do not panic. Just look them up on
                YouTube or watch relavant video from the Udemy course or
                Fardad's lecture. Just try to understand what they even are
                before beginning to code. Helps a lot. Most people quit because
                they struggle to understand so many new terms and concepts. You
                can find Fardad's lecture by clicking on the following link:

                You need your professor in this course since Seneca goes deeper
                in the course outline than any tutorial I could find online.
                Still, the Udemy course added covers most of the material you
                need.
              </li>
              <li>
                I notice that many students get really confused with the time
                and space complexity and get overwhelmed. It is one of the
                easiest parts. You can learn it within an hour or two on YouTube
                or through the Udemy course added. Make sure you do it.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Important Note: </strong> The content of this course is
                the questions you will be asked in almost every software job
                interview. Make sure you learn it before, throughout, or after
                the semester because you have to anyways.

              The Udemy course sections are unrelated to each other so they can
              be studied in any order. The following is the order that is
              closest to school curriculum but also makes it easier to
              understand what you do and why.

            <ul>
              <li>
                The three assignments together are worth 30%. The first
                assignment is the easiest. Do them as well as you can. You can
                skip the labs if you need to but not assignments, or not more
                than 1.
              </li>
              <li>
                Midterm has 2 significant parts. Time and space analysis and
                Linked Lists. Make sure you are comfortable with both.
              </li>
              <li>
                The final is more difficult. It includes graphs, trees, and hash
                tables. It is easier to ace the midterm than the final so do
                that.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <strong>Personal Note: </strong> My professor was Catherine Leung.
            She is a really nice person. her teaching is ok, but she really
            cares and even spent 1 full hour out of the class time to explain me
            something and help me with my assignment. BUT SHE GRADES VERY HARD!
            Beware of that. I think I would still pick her and just put a little
            more effort into the course.
